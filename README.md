Hello and welcome to `~/dotfiles`.
  
This is my very own collection of configuration I've been making for
years now, either adding or removing something, constant use of automation
and keybindings. I'm professionally oriented in dev/ops/sec so most things
are defined around that.

First and foremost, these are all basic stuff, but please for the sake of good,
don't just copydrop all the stuff. Create and learn from this repository and
enjoy your environment in unique way.
  
These configuration or part of it were used on many of my system-of-choice, from
 old Ubuntu 8.04 to MacOS HS. These fine lines are probably (atm) powering RHEL7  
 or I might be deadlocked from my remote :scream:.

There are of course some pre-requirements for this to work:

* Key are mapped to Macbook, Mac or Apple-like keyboard
* These files are constantly changed through day to day usage
* You are running UNIX like system

## XFCE4

It's powerful, micro and beautiful, if you make it that way. It's not resource
hungry and it's perfect deskenv imo. It's excatly what DE has to be.
  
* `xfce4/panel/launcher-10/#.desktop` - Terminal entry launcher from panel
* `xfce4/panel/cpugraph-11.rc` - A small dot-style cpu graph [img/c]
